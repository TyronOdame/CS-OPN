# CS-OPN

cs-opn is a cs2 case opening simulator. this web application will allow users to create their own account where they can store all the skins that they opened and compare skins with friends. Each user, once logged in, will get access to their own inventory where they can see all the skins they pulled for the cases, a cases tab where users will be able to pick and choose what cases they would like to open and the current amount of CBs (case bucks, what I am call the in app currency) they have. once a user buy a case, the case is sent to there inventory where they would be able to open the case and see what is inside. users can earn CB by logging in every day or selling the skins that they don't want in their inventory. if users want to know how much a skin cost in the actual cs2 market on skinport, they can ask an AI chat bot for a real life price check.
